# 1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.
x=15
y=30
z=x+y
print(z/2)
# 2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.
x = 2
y = 3
z = x + y
add_result = z

z = x - y
subtract_result = z

z = x * y
multiply_result = z

z = x / y
divide_result = z

z = x % y
remainder_result = z
print("{ ",add_result,",",subtract_result,",", multiply_result,",", divide_result,",", remainder_result," }")

# 3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.
name = "Hamza"
print(name)

# 4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.
x,y,z="banana", "mango", "apple"
print(y)

# 5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.
string="Hello\n"
print(string*10)

# 6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment

# 7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.

# 8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.

# 9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.

# 10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.
